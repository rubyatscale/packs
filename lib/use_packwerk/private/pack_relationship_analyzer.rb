            When using this script, ask yourself some questions like:
            - What do I want to support?
            - What do I *not* want to support?
            - What is considered simply an implementation detail, and what is essential to the behavior of my pack?
            - What is a simple, minimialistic API for clients to engage with the behavior of your pack?
            - How do I ensure my public API is not coupled to specific client's use cases?

            Looking at privacy violations can help guide the development of your public API, but it is just the beginning!

            The script will output in the following format:

            SomeConstant # This is the name of a class, constant, or module defined in your pack, outside of app/public
              - Total Count: 5 # This is the total number of uses of this outside your pack
              - By package: # This is a breakdown of the use of this constant by other packages
                # This is the number of files in this pack that this constant is used.
                # Check `packs/other_pack_a/deprecated_references.yml` under the '#{pack_name}'.'SomeConstant' key to see where this constant is used
                - packs/other_pack_a: 3
                - packs/other_pack_b: 2
            SomeClass # This is the second most violated class, constant, or module defined in your pack
              - Total Count: 2
              - By package:
                - packs/other_pack_a: 1
                - packs/other_pack_b: 1

            Lastly, remember you can use `bin/use_packwerk make_public #{pack_name}/path/to/file.rb` to make your class, constant, or module public API.
