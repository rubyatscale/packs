        Your next steps might be:

        1) Move files into your pack with `bin/packs move #{pack_name} path/to/file.rb`

        2) Run `bin/packwerk update-todo` to update the violations. Make sure to run `spring stop` if you've added new load paths (new top-level directories) in your pack.

        3) Expose public API in #{pack_name}/app/public. Try `bin/packs make_public #{pack_name}/path/to/file.rb`

        4) Update your readme at #{pack_name}/README.md

        2) Work to migrate clients of private API to your new public API

        This directory holds your public API!

        Any classes, constants, or modules that you want other packs to use and you intend to support should go in here.
        Anything that is considered private should go in other folders.

        If another pack uses classes, constants, or modules that are not in your public folder, it will be considered a "privacy violation" by packwerk.
        You can prevent other packs from using private API by using packwerk.

        Want to find how your private API is being used today?
        Try running: `bin/packs list_top_privacy_violations #{pack_name}`

        Want to move something into this folder?
        Try running: `bin/packs make_public #{pack_name}/path/to/file.rb`

        One more thing -- feel free to delete this file and replace it with a README.md describing your package in the main package directory.

        See #{documentation_link} for more info!

        Welcome to `#{pack_name}`!

        If you're the author, please consider replacing this file with a README.md, which may contain:
        - What your pack is and does
        - How you expect people to use your pack
        - Example usage of your pack's public API (which lives in `#{pack_name}/app/public`)
        - Limitations, risks, and important considerations of usage
        - How to get in touch with eng and other stakeholders for questions or issues pertaining to this pack (note: it is recommended to add ownership in `#{pack_name}/package.yml` under the `owner` metadata key)
        - What SLAs/SLOs (service level agreements/objectives), if any, your package provides
        - When in doubt, keep it simple
        - Anything else you may want to include!

        README.md files are under version control and should change as your public API changes.#{' '}
