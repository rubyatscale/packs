          If another pack uses classes, constants, or modules that are not in your public folder, it will be considered a "privacy violation" by packwerk.
          You can prevent other packs from using private API by using packwerk.

          Want to find how your private API is being used today?

          - How you expect people to use your pack

          - What SLAs/SLOs (service level agreements/objectives), if any, your package provides
          - When in doubt, keep it simple

          If another pack uses classes, constants, or modules that are not in your public folder, it will be considered a "privacy violation" by packwerk.
          You can prevent other packs from using private API by using packwerk.

          - What your pack is and does
          - How you expect people to use your pack
          - Example usage of your pack's public API (which lives in `packs/organisms/app/public`)
          - Limitations, risks, and important considerations of usage
          - How to get in touch with eng and other stakeholders for questions or issues pertaining to this pack (note: it is recommended to add ownership in `packs/organisms/package.yml` under the `owner` metadata key)
          - What SLAs/SLOs (service level agreements/objectives), if any, your package provides
          - When in doubt, keep it simple
          - Anything else you may want to include!

          README.md files are under version control and should change as your public API changes.#{' '}

        👋 Hi!


        You are moving one pack to be a child of a different pack. Check out https://github.com/rubyatscale/packs#readme for more info!

        ====================================================================================================
        File Operations


        Moving file packs/apples/app/services/apples/foo.rb to packs/fruits/apples/app/services/apples/foo.rb
        ====================================================================================================
        Next steps


        Your next steps might be:

        1) Delete the old pack when things look good: `git rm -r packs/apples`

        2) Run `bin/packwerk update-todo` to update the violations. Make sure to run `spring stop` first.

          This helps ensure a high quality signal in other engineers' PRs when inspecting new violations by ensuring there are no unrelated changes.

          1) Most likely, you may have stale violations, meaning there are old violations that no longer apply.

          3) You may have edited these files manually. It's recommended to use the `bin/packwerk update-todo` command to make changes to `package_todo.yml` files.

          In all cases, you can run `bin/packwerk update-todo` to update these files.
